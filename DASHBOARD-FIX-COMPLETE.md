# 🔧 Dashboard Flashing Issue - FIXED!

## What Was Wrong

You reported the dashboard was **flashing** between loading state and something else. This was caused by:

1. **Infinite re-render loop** - `getLoanDetails` in useEffect dependency array
2. **Rapid state changes** - Loading states changing too quickly
3. **Missing error handling** - Errors causing retries

---

## ✅ What I Fixed

### 1. **Removed Infinite Re-render**
**Problem:** `getLoanDetails` function in dependency array caused useEffect to run on every render

**Fix:**
```typescript
// BEFORE ❌
}, [isConnected, accountId, getLoanDetails]);

// AFTER ✅
}, [isConnected, accountId]);
// eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
```

---

### 2. **Improved Loading State Management**
**Problem:** Loading states were changing independently, causing flashing

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Only show loan details section when BOTH loadings are done
{!loading && !loadingLoan && loanDetails && parseFloat(loanDetails.borrowedAmount) > 0 && (
  <div className="bg-card border border-border rounded-lg p-6 mb-8">
    {/* Loan details... */}
  </div>
)}
```

---

### 3. **Added Better Error Handling**
**Problem:** Errors in mirror node calls were silently failing

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Added detailed error logging
const errorText = await response.text();
console.error('Mirror node error response:', errorText);

// More detailed error info
console.error('Error details:', {
  message: error.message,
  stack: error.stack,
});
```

---

### 4. **Created Debug Test Script**
**New:** `test-loan-details.js` to test mirror node calls independently

---

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

### Step 1: Clear Browser Cache
The frontend might have cached the old code:

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click refresh button
3. Click **"Empty Cache and Hard Reload"**

OR just:
```bash
cd frontend
# Stop the dev server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

---

### Step 2: Check Console for Errors
Open browser console and look for:

**Good signs:**
```
✅ Raw contract response: {...}
📊 Loan details from contract: {...}
```

**Bad signs:**
```
❌ Get loan details error: ...
Mirror node error response: ...
```

---

### Step 3: Test Mirror Node Directly
Run the test script to verify mirror node is working:

```bash
node test-loan-details.js
```

**When prompted, enter your account ID**

This will:
- ✅ Test the mirror node API
- ✅ Show your actual loan data
- ✅ Decode the contract response
- ✅ Verify function selector is correct

---

### Step 4: Check Dashboard
Go to: **http://localhost:3000/dashboard**

**Expected behavior:**
1. Shows "Loading..." briefly
2. Then shows loan details (if you have a loan)
3. OR shows "₦0 No active loan" (if you don't)
4. **NO flashing** between states

---

## 🔍 Debugging Guide

### If still flashing:

1. **Open Browser Console** (F12 → Console tab)

2. **Look for these logs:**
   ```
   🔍 Fetching loan details for: 0.0.XXXXXXX
   Calling contract with data: 0xa92cb501...
   ✅ Raw contract response: {...}
   📊 Loan details from contract: {...}
   ```

3. **Check for errors:**
   - Mirror node errors
   - Network errors
   - Invalid responses

4. **Share the console output** so I can debug further

---

### If loan details not showing:

Run the test script:
```bash
node test-loan-details.js
```

This will show:
- ✅ If mirror node is accessible
- ✅ If your account has a loan
- ✅ The exact data being returned
- ✅ Where the problem is

---

## 📊 How getLoanDetails Works

```
Frontend calls getLoanDetails(accountId)
        ↓
Convert account ID to EVM address
        ↓
Build mirror node API request
  POST https://testnet.mirrornode.hedera.com/api/v1/contracts/0.0.7138337/call
  Body: { data: "0xa92cb501..." }
        ↓
Mirror node queries the contract
        ↓
Contract returns 6 uint256 values:
  - collateralAmount
  - collateralToken
  - borrowedAmount
  - totalDebt
  - healthFactor
  - maxBorrow
        ↓
Frontend decodes the response
        ↓
Dashboard displays the data
```

## 🐛 Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue: Mirror Node Sometimes Slow
**Symptom:** Dashboard takes 5-10 seconds to load
**Cause:** Hedera testnet mirror node can be slow
**Workaround:** Just wait, it will load
**Status:** Normal behavior, not a bug

---

### Issue: "No active loan" showing but you borrowed
**Possible causes:**
1. Transaction is still processing (wait 10-30 seconds)
2. Contract address is wrong (check constants)
3. Account ID mismatch (verify in HashPack)

**To verify:**
```bash
node test-loan-details.js
# Enter your account ID
# Check if it returns loan data
```

---

### Issue: Health Factor shows 0%
**Cause:** No active loan (borrowedAmount is 0)
**This is normal** if you haven't borrowed yet

## ✅ Expected Behavior Now

### When you have NO loan:
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ Active Loan             │
│ ₦0                      │
│ No active loan          │
└─────────────────────────┘
```
No "Loan Details" section appears.

---

### When you HAVE a loan:
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ Active Loan             │
│ ₦1,000,000              │
│ Borrowed • Health: 200% │
└─────────────────────────┘

📊 Your Loan Details
┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐
│ Collateral    │ Borrowed      │ Total Debt    │
│ 500 tokens    │ ₦1,000,000    │ ₦1,002,500    │
├───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤
│ Health Factor │ Capacity      │ Interest      │
│ 200% ✅       │ ₦500,000      │ 5% APR        │
└───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘

[Repay Loan]  [Borrow More]
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Hard refresh your browser** (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Go to dashboard** (http://localhost:3000/dashboard)
3. **Check console** for any errors
4. **If still flashing:**
   - Run `node test-loan-details.js`
   - Share the console output
   - Share the test script output
5. **If working:**
   - Enjoy your properly functioning dashboard! 🎉

---

## 💡 Tips

1. **The loading is normal** - mirror node takes 1-3 seconds
2. **Check console first** if something seems wrong
3. **Use test script** to verify mirror node independently
4. **Hard refresh** after code changes
5. **Clear cache** if seeing old behavior

---

## ❓ Still Having Issues?

**Run these commands and share the output:**

```bash
# Test 1: Check mirror node
node test-loan-details.js

# Test 2: Check console logs
# (Open browser DevTools → Console tab)
# Copy all logs that start with "🔍" or "❌"
```

**Also tell me:**
- Does the dashboard flash? Or freeze? Or show errors?
- What do you see in the browser console?
- Did you hard refresh the browser?
- Are you using the latest code? (restart dev server)
