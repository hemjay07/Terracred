# üö® URGENT: Fix Deposit Collateral Issue

## Root Cause Found!

Your **backend/.env** was using the **OLD Master RWA token** (0.0.7119378) instead of the NEW one (0.0.7162666).

When you verified properties, they received tokens from the OLD token. But your frontend and contract are configured for the NEW token. This mismatch caused all deposit failures.

---

## ‚úÖ What I've Fixed

1. ‚úÖ **backend/.env** - Updated Master RWA token ID from 0.0.7119378 ‚Üí 0.0.7162666
2. ‚úÖ **frontend/.env.local** - Updated token ID to match (already correct in constants)
3. ‚úÖ **Created test script** - `test-deposit-flow.js` to verify everything

All config files now use: **0.0.7162666**

---

## üîß What You Need to Do (Step by Step)

### Step 1: Restart Backend ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED

The backend is still running with the old config. You **MUST restart it**:

```bash
# Open a new terminal in the backend directory
cd backend

# Stop the current backend (Ctrl+C in the terminal where it's running)
# OR kill it:
kill 28718

# Start with new config
npm start
# or
npm run dev
```

**Verify it started correctly:**
- Look for the startup message
- It should show "Server running on port 3001"

---

### Step 2: Test Your Setup

Run the comprehensive test script:

```bash
node test-deposit-flow.js
```

When prompted, enter your HashPack account ID (e.g., 0.0.XXXXXXX)

This will check:
- ‚úì Token balance
- ‚úì Token associations (you + lending pool)
- ‚úì Contract whitelist
- ‚úì Approval capability

**If all tests PASS** ‚Üí Skip to Step 4
**If any tests FAIL** ‚Üí Continue to Step 3

---

### Step 3: Fix Any Failed Tests

Based on the test output:

#### ‚ùå If "User has 0 tokens" fails:

You need to verify a NEW property or re-verify an existing one:

**Option A: Create a new test property**
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/tokenize
2. Fill in a test property (any values)
3. Submit it
4. Go to http://localhost:3000/admin
5. Click "Verify" on your new property
6. **CHECK THE CONSOLE** - it should now mint to the NEW token (0.0.7162666)

**Option B: Re-verify existing property**
1. Delete the old property from the data store
2. Create and verify a new one

---

#### ‚ùå If "Token not associated" fails:

**Associate the NEW token in HashPack:**

1. Open your HashPack wallet
2. Go to **Tokens** tab
3. Click **"Associate Token"**
4. Enter token ID: `0.0.7162666`
5. Confirm (costs ~$0.05 in HBAR)

---

#### ‚ùå If "Lending pool not associated" fails:

**Send 1 token to the pool:**

```bash
node send-token-to-pool.js 0.0.7162666
```

---

#### ‚ùå If "Token not whitelisted" fails:

**Whitelist the token in the contract:**

```bash
node whitelist-token.js 0.0.7162666
```

---

### Step 4: Verify Everything Works

After fixes, run the test again:

```bash
node test-deposit-flow.js
```

**All tests should PASS** ‚úÖ

---

### Step 5: Try Deposit Collateral

1. Restart your frontend (if needed):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   # Ctrl+C to stop
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Go to http://localhost:3000

3. Connect your HashPack wallet

4. Navigate to **Borrow** page

5. Select your property (the one verified with the NEW token)

6. Enter amount and click **Deposit Collateral**

7. You'll see TWO wallet prompts:
   - **Prompt 1:** Approve token spending ‚Üí **SIGN THIS**
   - **Prompt 2:** Deposit collateral ‚Üí **SIGN THIS**

8. Wait for confirmation

**It should succeed!** üéâ

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Still getting protobuf error?

1. **Check which token your property has:**
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/dashboard
   - Look at your property details
   - Check the token ID

2. **If it shows 0.0.7119378 (OLD):**
   - This property was verified with the old backend
   - You need to verify a NEW property after backend restart
   - OR re-verify this property

3. **Check the actual transaction:**
   - Copy the transaction ID from the error
   - Go to: https://hashscan.io/testnet/transaction/[TX_ID]
   - Look for the real error (might be CONTRACT_REVERT_EXECUTED)

---

### How do I know which token I have?

Run this in HashPack:
1. Go to **Tokens** tab
2. Look for **TCRED** token
3. Check the token ID:
   - **0.0.7119378** = OLD token (won't work for deposit)
   - **0.0.7162666** = NEW token (will work!)

---

### Do I need to associate both tokens?

**NO!** You only need the NEW token (0.0.7162666).

The OLD token (0.0.7119378) is no longer used. You can ignore any tokens from that ID.

## üìä Quick Reference

| File | Old Value | New Value | Status |
|------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| backend/.env | 0.0.7119378 | 0.0.7162666 | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| frontend/.env.local | 0.0.7119378 | 0.0.7162666 | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| frontend/constants | 0.0.7162666 | 0.0.7162666 | ‚úÖ Already correct |
| contracts/.env | 0.0.7162666 | 0.0.7162666 | ‚úÖ Already correct |

## üéØ Summary

1. ‚úÖ Config files updated
2. ‚è≥ **YOU MUST:** Restart backend
3. ‚è≥ **YOU MUST:** Run test script
4. ‚è≥ **YOU MUST:** Verify a NEW property OR re-verify existing
5. ‚è≥ **YOU MUST:** Associate token in HashPack (if not already)
6. ‚úÖ Try deposit again

## üí° Why Did This Happen?

The project went through a token migration:
- **v1 Token (OLD):** 0.0.7119378 - Had KYC issues
- **v2 Token (NEW):** 0.0.7162666 - No KYC, easier testing

Your contracts and frontend were updated, but the **backend/.env was missed**.

This is now fully synchronized! üéâ
